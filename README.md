# JavascriptMas-by-scrimba


## Description
This is a javascript advent calender like that is hosted by <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas">scrimba</a>, I like this challenge because it is a way to improve on my javascript skill and this would serve as a motivation for me to finish something i start.

The challenges are splitted into days which means 24 challenges till christmas.

### Day 1 
This was a simple christmas countdown that just checks how many days until christmas.
